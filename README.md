## Technologies used

The Microsoft SQL Server database management system is used to store data. To interact with the data, the System.Data.SqlClient (ADO.NET) component was used.

## Before Starting

Before starting the program, you need to run the script "scriptWithData.sql" in MS SQL Server Management Studio, then you can build the project.
The database contains existing phone numbers with password "Password123!" (all passwords are encrypted by MD5).
